\section{Data and methods}

This section introduces the rain gauge measurements that are used as reference
data in this study together with the retrieval algorithms that the Hydronn
retrieval will be evaluated against. Following this, the implementation of the
hydronn retrieval is presented.

\subsection{Rain gauge data}

The rain gauge measurement that are used in this study were compiled by the
Institute for Space Research (INPE) and consists of hourly gauge measurements
covering the time range May 2000 until May 2020. From this data December of
2020 will be used for the evaluation of the Hydronn retrieval while the data
from 2018 and 2019 will be used to derive a priori corrections.

The geographical distribution and the mean precipitation during December 2012 of
gauges is displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:gauges}. While the gauge density is fairly
high on the south-western coast of Brazil it decreases markedly towards the
North-West. The highest precipitation is observed on the lower-central west
coast of the country extending into the north west. Very low precipitation rates
are observed in the north east.

    distribution of gauges by means of the number of gauges falling into
    each hexagon. Hexagon-free areas are not covered by gauges. Panel (b)
    shows the mean precipitation rate in each gauge.
    }
  \label{fig:gauges}
\end{figure}
    

\subsection{HYDRO}

HYDRO is the currently operational real-time precipitation retrieval at the
Center for Weather Forecast and Climate Studies/National Institute for Space
Research (CPTEC/INPE). It is based on the auto-estimator \citep{vicente98}, a
semi-empirical retrieval technique using a power-law relationship between
$10.8\ \unit{\mu m}$ IR brightness temperatures and correction factors taking
into account moisture parameters and cloud structure. The current version of the
retrieval is described in \citet{siqueira19}, which also introduces regional
correction factors derived from a climatology of estimated surface precipitation
from the radars of the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM,
\citeauthor{simpson96}, \citeyear{simpson96}) and GPM. For this study we use the
corrected version of HYDRO proposed in \citet{siqueira19} with the regional
corrections applied. As is was found to yield the most accurate results.

\subsection{PERSIANN CSS}

The PERSIANN Cloud Classification System (CCS, \citeauthor{hong04},
\citeyear{hong04}) is another precipitation retrieval algorithm that uses IR
observations from geostationary satellites to retrieve precipitation. It is
included in this study as a reference dataset due to it being available globally
at a 1-hour resolution. The algorithm is a fully empirical algorithm based on
self-organizing maps, an early form of neural networks, that are used to
classify cloud patches and associate them to power-law relationships, which are
used to estimate the precipitation at each pixel. Although the global CCS
dataset is currently being replaced by the updated PERSIANN Dynamic
Infrared-Rain rate (PDIR-Now, \citeauthor{nguyen20}, \citeyear{nguyen20}) we
decided not to use it due to the first half of the evaluation period missing
from the online archive.


\subsection{GPM IMERG}

The Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG,
\citeauthor{huffman15}, \citeyear{huffman15}) combines retrievals from PMW
and IR observations as global rain gauge measurements to produce global,
hourly measurements of precipitation. Due to its reliance on a wealth of
measurement sources and the sophistication of the retrieval pipeline, the
product can be considered one of the most accurate precipitation hourly
precipitation products. 

\subsection{Hydronn}

Hydronn is a neural network based real time precipitation retrieval algorithm
that uses IR and VIS observation from the GOES-16 geostrationary satellite. It
has been developed specifically to retrieve precipitation over Brazil.

\subsubsection{Training data}

The training data for the Hydronn retrieval consists of co-locations of input
observations from the GOES-16 ABI \citep{schmit18} and retrieved surface
precipitation from the GPM combined product \citep{grecu16}. GOES ABI
observations were extracted at their native resolutions and combined with the
surface precipitation retrieved from the GPM combined product by mapping it to
the $2\ \unit{km}$ resolution of the ABI's IR channels. Co-locations were
extracted for the time span 2018-01-01 until 2021-09-01. Observations from the
year 2020 were excluded from the training and are only used in the evaluation of
the hydronn configurations.

The distribution of precipitation rates in the training dataset is displayed in
Fig.~\ref{fig:training_data}. The detection threshold for precipitation of the
GPM radar between $0.2$ and $0.4\ \unit{mm h^{-1}$ is clearly visible in the
  distributions. In addition to this, there is a moderate seasonal cycle, which
  mainly impacts the likelihood of moderate precipitation. The gauge
  measurements exhibit a stronger effect of the seasonal cycle especially for
  strong rain. Despite those differences, it cannot be concluded that the
  training and gauge data are inconsistent, since the differences may be due to
  the satellite measurements corresponding to instantaneous measurements,
  whereas the gauge measurements are accumulated over the span of an hour.

    seasonal PDFs of precipitation rates in the training data. Panel (b)
    shows the PDFs of precipitation rates measured by the gauges

    background trace the PDFs of the precipitation rates in the training data
    shown in Panel (a).
    }
  \label{fig:training_data}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Retrieval configurations}

The Hydronn retrieval has been implemented in three different configurations in
order to assess how the choice of input observations and retrieval resolution
affects the retrieval. The most basic retrieval configuration is the
\hydronnfourir retrieval, which only uses the $10.7\ \unit{\mu\ m}$ channel.
This configuration has the advantage of using only a single infrared channel,
that is available from all currently operational geostationary
satellites and most historical sensors. The reliance on IR observations alone has
furthermore the advantage the information content of the input observation is
independent of the availability of sunlight. Because of it's sensitivity to cloud
top height this channel has a long history of being used in precipitation retrievals
and is also the sole channel used by the HYDRO and PERSIANN CCS algorithms.

The next configuration named \hydronnfourall uses all available GOES channels at
a resolution of $4\ \unit{km}$ at zenith. Except for relying  more satellite
observations as input data, this configuration  is identical to the \hydronnfourir
configuration.

The final configuration aims to exploit the full potential of GOES observations
for precipitation retrievals. The input includes observations from all GOES
channels at their native resolution while precipitation is retrieved at a
resolution of $2\ \unit{km}$ at zenith. Since 

\subsubsection{Neural network model}

All Hydronn retrievals are based on a common convolutional neural network
(CNN) architecture. An illustration of the architecture is provided in
Fig.~\ref{fig:architecture}. 

The posterior distribution of the retrieval is estimated by approximating the
PDF of the posterior distribution. Following \citet{metnet}, this is achieved by
discretizing the range of expected precipitation values and predicting for each
bin the probability of the observed precipitation falling it. This is
conveniently implemented by treating the retrieval as a classification problem
and using a cross-entropy loss to train the networks. During inference, the logits
predicted by the network are transformed into a probability density by applying
a softmax activation and normalizing the bin probabilities.

\subsubsection{Retrieval output}

For each retrieved pixel, the predicted posterior distribution is used to derive
the posterior mean, a sample of the posterior distribution and 14 quantiles of
the posterior distribution. The 14 quantiles are retained as a more compact
representation of the posterior distribution than the probabilities over the 128
bins that are produced by the networks. In addition to providing a direct
measure of retrieval uncertainty, the retained quantiles can be used to infer
e.g. probabilities of the instantaneous rain rates exceeding certain thresholds.

\subsubsection{Calculating precipitation accumulations}

The precipitation distributions prediced by hydronn are instantaneous
precipitaiton rates. Since GOES 16 imagery is available every 10 minutes. This
raises the question how to integrate these distributions to hourly precipitation
rates. The difficulty with this is that it is unclear how the retrieval
uncertainties should be propagated in time. For this study, we have implemented
two heuristics for doing this that represent different assumptions on the
temporal correlation of the errors in the precipitation retrieval.

The first approach is to average the predicted posterior distributions. For the
case of multiple identical observations, this approach would conserve the
retrieval uncertainties and may thus be viewed to correspond to a assuming a
strong dependence between the retrieval errors for consecutive observations.

The second approach is to assume independence of the retrieval uncertainty. For
identical, consecutive observations this will cause the retrieval uncertainty to
decay. Given the binned probability densities of two independent random
variables, the PDF of their sum can be approximated by calculating weighted
histograms of the outer sum of the bin centroids weighted by the product of the
bin probabilities.

For the evaluation of the Hydronn retrieval we calculate hourly accumulations
the PDFs for hourly accumulations using both approaches. We then calculate the
retrieval outputs described above. For each retrieval configuration two types of
hourly accumulations are produced. One corresponding to assuming dependent
retrieval error, which will we mark with '(dep.)' where necessary. And one
corresponding to assuming independent retrieval errors, which we will mark with
'(indep.)'. It should be noted, however, that this only affects the predicted
retrieval uncertainties and not the predicted mean values.
